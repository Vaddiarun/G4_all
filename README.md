Purpose
The script automates several processes like installing dependencies, interacting with serial ports, creating CSV files, calculating CRC checksums, and working with Git repositories. It is designed to perform system-related tasks and handle automation for multiple use cases.

Key Functions
Dependency Management:

check_python_version(): Checks if the installed Python version is compatible.
update_version(): Upgrades pip to the required version.
Functions to install specific packages: install_csv(), install_serial_tools(), install_sys(), install_pyserial(), install_pyvisa(), install_pytz_and_time(), install_pandas(), install_flask(), and install_gitpython().
Serial Communication:

list_aviable_com_ports(): Lists all available COM ports.
read_and_write_Serialport(): Reads and writes data through a serial port and logs responses.
CSV File Operations:

creating_CSV_File(): Creates a CSV file with sample data.
CRC Calculation:

calculate_crc16(data: bytes): Calculates the CRC-16 checksum for a given data input.
File Operations:

delete_all_files_in_folder(): Deletes all files within a specified directory.
Automation:

auto_open_apps(): Opens the Google Chrome application.
API Interaction:

post_api(): Sends data to a specified API endpoint using an HTTP POST request.
Git Operations:

fetch_git_username_and_commit_id(): Retrieves the Git username and commit ID from the user.
remove_all_contents(): Removes all contents of a specified directory.
clone_repository_and_checkout(): Clones a Git repository and checks out a specific commit ID.
Execution Flow
The script executes the following steps when run:

Installs all required dependencies.
Lists available serial ports and communicates through them.
Creates a CSV file and writes sample data.
Calculates the CRC value for a given input.
Deletes files from a specified folder.
Sends a POST request to a defined API.
Opens the Chrome browser.
Prompts for Git credentials and clones a repository, checking out a specific commit.
